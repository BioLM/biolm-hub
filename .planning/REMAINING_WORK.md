# REMAINING WORK — master open-items ledger

> ## ▶▶ FABLE SESSION LIVE STATUS — 2026-07-05 (session `final-oss-release-sprint-1`; trust THIS first)
> Fresh Fable took over from the FABLE_HANDOFF. Independently re-audited everything (7 fresh-context
> agents vs live Modal/R2/code/git/internal-repo/testing-harness/skills) before touching anything.
>
> **▶ MILESTONE-2 UPDATE (later same session; HEAD=`a3b3d2f`; every push CI-GREEN). ALL Modal-free code +
> docs + chai1 + interim Modal validation DONE. Only the full deploy matrix + skills-proof + residual +
> launch-staging remain.** Done since the Phase-1 block below:
> - **chai1 build FIXED** (`9297d1a`): root cause = chai-lab `pip_install(gpu=…)` ran on the scarce A100
>   builder → intermittent server-side "no stages" flake. Removed the `gpu=` arg → CPU builder
>   (deterministic; verified across force-builds; fold works; goldens regenerated). evo/evo2 keep `gpu=`
>   (flash-attn CUDA) legitimately.
> - **Runtime creds-less gap CLOSED** (`09cb719`): the runtime `@app.cls(secrets=[cloudflare_r2_secret])`
>   in all 37 app.py was un-gated → a creds-less external user's `app.deploy()` would fail. Added commons
>   `runtime_secrets()` + `skip_modal_secrets()` (config.py), swept all 37 to `secrets=runtime_secrets()`.
>   Import stays auth-free. So creds-less = set `BIOLM_SKIP_MODAL_SECRETS=1` (gates BOTH build + runtime).
> - **Docs overhaul** (`2f14fe5` site + `2e60447` OSS + `a3b3d2f` KB): mkdocs usability assessment done +
>   implemented — HTTP calling-contract page + per-action curl, resolved schema defaults, auto-generated
>   Errors reference page, real bh-serve 5-min flow, See-also/Alternatives/arXiv/SUMMARY cleanups; README
>   creds-less accuracy fix + first screen; CONTRIBUTING make-check/CI accuracy; esm2/evo arxiv-field DOI
>   fix + dsm MODEL.md table. Stale generated docs leaks removed + gitignored. DEFERRED P2: page-split
>   into tabs (G10), catalog filter (G11), search-index exclusion (G7).
> - **Interim Modal validation GREEN** (esm2-8m + thermompnn on biolm-hub-dev): the residue_embeddings
>   rename serializes, `BIOLM_SKIP_MODAL_SECRETS=1` deploy reads weights over r2.dev + serves, conda/
>   StrEnum-3.10 build holds, numeric golden comparison engages + passes (creds-less golden read works).
>   → **GREEN to fan out the full 36-model matrix.**
>
> **▶▶ THE FAN-OUT PLAN (the immediate remaining work — Milestone B #4).** Deploy ALL 36 SHIP + dummy to
> `biolm-hub-dev` in cost-aware waves (~6-8 concurrent), heavy last. Per model: `bh deploy`/app.py
> --force-deploy → **`modal app logs <app> --env biolm-hub-dev` health-verify (NEVER trust green deploy)**
> → cold-invoke every action → integration `pytest models/<m>/test.py -m integration` (creds-less golden
> read over r2.dev now works). Waves: **0 CPU** (ablang2, antifold, biotite, deepviscosity, dna_chisel,
> immunebuilder, mpnn, prody, sadie, abodybuilder3-plddt, esm1v×5, progen2-oas, dnabert2) → **1 T4**
> (esm_if1, esm1b, igbert×2, igt5×2, immunefold×2, msa_transformer, progen2 med/large/bfd90, spurs,
> temberture×2, thermompnn, thermompnn_d, zymctrl, e1-150m, esm2-35m, esmc-300m) → **2 mid-GPU L4/A10G**
> (evo×2, evo2×2, omni_dna, prostt5×2, e1-650m/3b, dsm×3, esmfold, esm2-3b, abodybuilder3-language) →
> **3 A100** (boltzgen, rf3, chai1, dsm-3B).
> **GOLDENS TO REGEN + REVIEW (9): schema-driven** esmc, e1, msa_transformer, dsm, igt5, immunefold;
> **validator-wired (now numeric)** thermompnn(4), thermompnn_d(6), immunefold(4). Regen via
> `MODAL_ENVIRONMENT=biolm-hub-dev .venv/bin/python scratchpad/gen_goldens.py <slug>` (routes writes thru
> the deployed `golden-io` app). Review: linter (schema/NaN/shape/range) + type-based spot-check.
> **MUST also:** settle the **esm1v phantom crash-loop** (deploy fresh, read logs); **deploy-verify the
> sadie→gateway v1 round-trip** (deploy gateway + sadie, call through it); **creds-less spot-check** a few
> models with `BIOLM_SKIP_MODAL_SECRETS=1`; **esm2 per-variant golden scoping** — `esm2/fixture.py` only
> generates 3B goldens, so non-3B encode/predict integration cases 404 → either gen per-variant goldens
> or scope those cases to 3B (log_prob is validator-based, fine for all variants).
> **DEFERRED to residual-close (#8):** K3 = add `default_factory` to `params` in schemas that lack it
> (makes params genuinely optional, resolves the "Required:yes vs optional-description" contradiction on
> ~31 pages — a schema-uniformity fix, Modal-free, no golden impact).
> **THEN:** skills executability proof (#7 — fresh agent follows model-implementation dummy→check+docs+
> deploy+goldens & model-knowledge-base 5 KG files) → residual close (#8) → launch staging (#9:
> contacts/D2 human items, 5-min quickstart from clean checkout, W-launch one-step-from-go; irreversibles
> = human). **RACE HAZARD: never edit models/ during a Modal build — do all models/ code edits (K3, any
> bug fixes) in no-build windows and commit before building.**
>
> **USER DECISIONS (this session):** prod = **OSS-repo-only** (prod `biolm-hub` env stays empty; users
> deploy to their own Modal) · R2 legacy trees = **delete now** (DONE) · prody/OpenBabel = **accept**
> (keep prody) · schema uniformity = **converge fully + fix bugs**. Deferred-to-launch (not blocking):
> D2 GitHub `modal-dev` env+secrets+label; D4 confirm support+security@/support+conduct@ inboxes are
> monitored.
>
> **✅ PHASE 1 (Modal-free code tail) COMPLETE — CI GREEN** (run 28731926137; HEAD=`c857e17`). CI caught +
> fixed two env-specific issues my local gates missed: a black-formatting nit (pre-commit is the real
> style gate, NOT `uvx black`) and — important — the credential-less secret switch had an import-time
> `Secret.from_name().hydrate()` probe that needs Modal auth, crashing app.py import (test collection/
> docs/schema) in a no-token env; fixed by deferring secret resolution to deploy time and making the
> creds-less path the explicit `BIOLM_SKIP_MODAL_SECRETS=1` opt-out (import is now auth-free + network-free;
> verified via no-auth full collection). **LESSON: always run `.venv/bin/python -m pre_commit run
> --all-files` (not uvx black) before push, and remember CI has no Modal token — app.py imports must never
> require auth.**
>
> **DONE this session (committed on `main`, HEAD=`c857e17`, CI green):**
> - **R2 public-ready cleanup DONE + verified** — deleted legacy `biolm-hub/models/` (274 GB) +
>   `model-store/` (36 GB) = 311 GB via `scratchpad/r2_cleanup.py --execute`. Bucket now = ONLY
>   `model-weights/models/` (273.6 GB, 32 slugs, all markers complete) + `test-data/models/` (36 dirs).
>   Zero raw PDFs, zero dropped-model weights (tempro went with the legacy tree).
> - **Schema uniformity (`3024aaa`)** — residue_embeddings converged (7 models + glossary de-dup),
>   mean_plddt, 4 DTOs re-based to ResponseModel, igbert/igt5 pad-row slicing, ablang2 encode unified,
>   8 stale doc refs fixed. esm1v predict left as-is (semantically distinct fill-mask output — bar-#7
>   reclassification, documented). Old names preserved via aliases.
> - **`#6` commons (`88c2474`)** — build_partial_payload de-dup, gateway payload serialization (sadie
>   `__reduce__` stopgap removed), seed_torch lifted to commons.util.device.
> - **Credential-less path (`bb8d464`)** — optional R2 secret mount (probe + `BIOLM_SKIP_MODAL_SECRETS`);
>   anonymous r2.dev golden-read fallback so `pytest -m integration` runs creds-less.
> - **Skills (`fc82a03`)** — 5 defects fixed, `models/dummy/fixture.py` template added, `make docs` gate
>   added to both skills. **Cosmetics (`8d7f1f0`)** — pyproject mypy-comment/black-exclude, prody drift.
> - Each change fresh-reviewer-verified (schema/commons/skills reviewers ran; all SAFE).
>
> **NEXT (in order): (1)** chai1 build determinism (Modal). **(2)** Milestone B — deploy ALL 36+dummy to
> `biolm-hub-dev` creds-aware waves (CPU→T4→mid→A100), `modal app logs`-verify health, cold-invoke every
> action, settle the `esm1v` phantom crash-loop (deploy fresh), **regenerate the 6 goldens** (esmc, e1,
> msa_transformer, dsm, igt5, immunefold), REVIEW every golden, make `pytest -m integration` genuinely
> pass for all 36, **deploy-verify** sadie-gateway-v1-roundtrip + secret-mount both/none paths +
> live-validate creds-less r2.dev read (use `BIOLM_SKIP_MODAL_SECRETS=1` from dev). **(3)** testing
> validator-gap (deterministic models: thermompnn/thermompnn_d) + tolerance audit (immunefold rmsd 1e-4)
> + snapshot 7 Category-B structures to R2 shared/. **(4)** skills executability proof (fresh agent
> follows both skills end-to-end). **(5)** residual close (#8) + launch staging (#9: contacts/D2, 5-min
> quickstart from clean checkout, W-launch one-step-from-go; irreversibles = human).
>
> **KEY FACTS:** repo `BioLM/biolm-hub` exists + PRIVATE + `main` pushed; prod env empty; secrets clean
> (only cloudflare-r2 + hf-api-token; stale ones gone); git HISTORY still dirty (nuke at launch, planned);
> `.planning/` deleted at launch. Local golden reads: creds-less HTTP now works, else route via Modal
> (`scratchpad/golden_io.py`); never put R2 creds on the shell. Race hazard: never edit `models/` during
> a Modal build.

> ## 🔄 STATUS RECONCILIATION — 2026-07-05 (added post-overnight; read before the body)
> This ledger is a **2026-06-28→30 snapshot**; a lot of §1–§4 is now DONE. For current status trust
> `.planning/FABLE_HANDOFF.md` + the reconciliation banner atop `RELEASE_ROADMAP.md`. Treat the body's
> "TODO/deferred" items as **verify-then-close** — many already landed.
>
> **DONE since this was written:** Gate-1 code (drops → **36 SHIP + dummy**, `biolm-hub`/`bh` rebrand,
> R2 uniform re-layout, `#5` schema standardization, esmc/igbert/igt5→MIT, plus-addressed contacts) +
> **CI green** · **golden fixtures 35/36** generated to `biolm-hub/test-data/models/<slug>/` · **`mypy
> --strict` = 0 tree-wide and now BLOCKING in CI** — this **retires the strict-mypy blocker** tracked in
> this ledger.
>
> **STILL OPEN (the real v1 tail):**
> - **`chai1`** Modal image-build bug (its golden is the only one missing → 35/36).
> - **Full 36-model deploy + integration/deployment matrix** (§1 "Milestone B", at the *final* state —
>   the prior "Milestone B DONE" notes were a sample pass, not the full matrix).
> - **`#6` commons** (§2 W3b): sadie gateway-serialize, `decorator.py` partial-payload de-dup,
>   `seed_everything` lift — runtime-path changes needing a representative deploy-verify.
> - **License / secret / R2 hygiene** (§3): the *code* is de-internalized + gitleaks-gated, but the
>   **live R2 bucket still needs a public-ready cleanup** (legacy `biolm-hub/models/` ~255 GB +
>   `model-store/` ~34 GB + any partial/corrupt caches), and the per-model inferred-copyright confirms +
>   prody-OpenBabel + no-raw-PDFs checks need the human.
> - **W-launch** (§4): everything except the two irreversibles (nuke git history, flip repo public).
> - Round-1's residual (`reviews/round-1/PHASE_B_DEFERRED.md`) collapses onto the buckets above — see
>   `FABLE_HANDOFF.md` §1 for the per-item mapping; do NOT re-review round-1 from scratch.

> # ⛳ ON RESUME, READ `.planning/RELEASE_ROADMAP.md` FIRST.
> That doc is the **authoritative, decision-forward resume anchor** (2026-07-01): current state, the ordered
> release path (Phases A–E), and the ⭐ **decisions-for-you** ordered by importance with clear actions +
> recommendations. **Milestone B is DONE** (all 38 SHIP models deploy+runtime-validated on dev; 9 bugs fixed).
> This ledger below is HISTORICAL context — much of §1–§4 describes already-completed work; RELEASE_ROADMAP.md
> + `MILESTONE_B_PROGRESS.md` + `MAINTAINER_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` are current.

> **Read this FIRST on resume.** Single source of truth for EVERYTHING not yet done. Nothing here is
> forgotten — only deferred. Cross-references the detailed docs (`00_MASTER_PLAN`, `02_MODEL_INCLUSION_MATRIX`,
> `03_WORKSTREAMS`, `04_TESTING_STRATEGY`, `W4_ACQUISITION_PLAN`, `W5_HARDENING_GUIDE`, `COMMONS_REQUESTS`).
> Snapshot at the **2026-06-28 pause** (session `oss-stage3-w5-fanout`). Internal file — deleted at launch.

> ## ▶ RESUME HERE (in progress 2026-06-30, session `oss-w3b-wsec`)
> **NEW this session (committed on `main`):** `88a8a11` **DROP `peptides`** from v1 (upstream license
> dispute → catalog now **38 SHIP + dummy**); `c6c8a5a` **deferred biolm-hub rebrand bundle documented**
> (`.planning/RENAME_TO_BIOLM_HUB.md`); `cf3f4fd` **`params_version`→`weights_version` rename** (117 files,
> mechanical, internal @dataclass field — no API/R2 impact). Schema guard ✓ **39 model dirs** (38 SHIP +
> dummy); 125 Modal-free tests pass (1 fail = pre-existing `test_cache` R2-creds).
>
> **USER DECISIONS folded in (2026-06-30):**
> - **biolm-hub rebrand = DEFERRED to "just before launch"** (one bundle: repo name `biolm-models`→`biolm-hub`,
>   **CLI `bm`→`bh`**, Modal envs `biolm-models`→`biolm-hub` / `biolm-models-dev`→`biolm-hub-dev`, and
>   **re-path the `biolm-public` bucket under a `biolm-hub/` prefix mirroring the repo tree**
>   `r2://biolm-public/biolm-hub/models/esm2/…`). Full pre-computed checklist in `RENAME_TO_BIOLM_HUB.md`.
>   The GitHub repo does NOT exist yet → CREATE `BioLM/biolm-hub` at launch (not a rename). Keep names as-is
>   until then; **focus stays on dev/test of the rest first.**
> - **peptides** dropped (above).
> - **`weights_version`** rename done (above).
> - **R2 anonymous public-read = ENABLED** by the cofounder via the bucket's **Public Development URL**:
>   `https://pub-c56611cf24404740b0ff53b356a6b48d.r2.dev` (anonymous HTTPS GET, rate-limited, no S3 LIST).
>   Resolves Open-Q #1. **✅ DONE (block 3, `fb0afaa`):** new `models/commons/storage/r2_http.py`
>   (`restore_weights_via_http`) reads cached weights anonymously over r2.dev when no S3 creds present —
>   manifest-driven (r2.dev can't LIST, so it GETs `.r2_manifest.json` then each key), gated by the
>   `.r2_cache_complete` marker; retry/backoff Session, URL-encoded keys, path-traversal guard, streamed-
>   response cleanup; fresh-Opus reviewed (all 4 should-fixes applied) + 11 Modal-free tests. Branched at the
>   two weight-read seams (`_acquire_r2_only` → `_acquire_r2_only_via_http`; `restore_from_r2_atomic`) via
>   `config.r2_public_url` + `r2.r2_credentials_present()`. Writes stay CI-gated. The read URL is
>   `{public_url}/{key}` so it survives the `biolm-hub/` bucket-prefix re-path unchanged.
>   **⚠️ FOLLOW-UPS (NOT done — required for the end-to-end creds-less deploy):** (a) **activation switch** —
>   make the `cloudflare-r2` Modal secret mount OPTIONAL in `commons/modal/downloader.py:113` (today it's
>   `secrets=[cloudflare_r2_secret, ...]`, which Modal requires to exist, so a creds-less deploy can't even
>   start — this is exactly why Milestone A's esm2 blocked). Use `Secret.from_name(..., required=False)` or
>   conditional inclusion; Modal-gated. (b) **Live-validate** the r2.dev fetch on a representative deploy at
>   Milestone B (does the Modal container actually pull over r2.dev + cache correctly). The read CODE is done
>   and Modal-free-tested; (a)+(b) flip it on.
> - **Modal CI token:** secret names are **`MODAL_TOKEN_ID` / `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`** (identical to internal
>   `biolm-modal` `.github/`; our `deploy.yml` already uses them). **User action:** add both (+ `R2_*`) as
>   **Environment secrets on the `modal-dev` environment** of the (future) repo — env-scoped, so org secrets
>   don't auto-apply. Same token values as the internal repo.
>
> **Modal-free workstreams — ✅ essentially COMPLETE this session.** Done & committed:
> - **Block 3** R2 unauthenticated HTTP read path (`fb0afaa`).
> - **W3b commons reconciliation:** `protocols-r2-bkt`/`ngc-cli-api-key` secrets already gone (verified);
>   dead `local_models_path` removed (`7c24838`); accepted-but-unread fields removed
>   (`monitor_directories`/`use_auth_token`/`bypass_detected`/`bypass_locations`, 13 files); `r2_then_archive`
>   NIT-1 clobber fix (two-phase clear). [Commits in `git log`.]
> - **W-sec:** the `biolm-modal`/`qa` de-internalization sweep is **VERIFIED CLEAN** across all shipped files
>   (the old offenders were dropped models esmstabp/boltz + already-swept files; only a skill *instruction*
>   not-to-use-it remains, which is correct). gitleaks secret-scan CI gate + `.gitleaks.toml` added (needs a
>   first-CI-run confirm). Dead `esmstabp` T20 ignore removed. License needs-human items consolidated into
>   `.planning/MAINTAINER_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`. **No copyleft models remain** (peptides dropped → catalog is
>   permissive; prody MIT + transitive OpenBabel system-dep noted; tempro = all-rights-reserved decision in
>   the checklist).
> - **Round-1 tail:** skill `nt/`/`esm3/` excluded-model refs fixed.
> - **mypy-over-`.github/scripts`** (Phase-A-deferred 67 errors): IN PROGRESS (delegated).
>
> **DEFERRED (with rationale) — Modal-free but lower-value / safer-with-deploy → Phase-C or Milestone B:**
> - `seed_everything` lift to commons — the abodybuilder3 vs immunebuilder impls **diverge** (Lightning +
>   PYTHONHASHSEED vs logging), so it's not a clean de-dup; shared core is ~8 lines; both are GPU models
>   untestable locally → fold into Milestone B or leave.
> - `STANDARD_PROTEIN_HOMOLOGS` shared asset (e1 only) — marginal; do when another model reuses it.
> - PHASE_B_DEFERRED group B (response class-name drift, DTO inheritance, plddt/Tm field convergence) —
>   schema-class touches, safer batched with the Milestone-B response-shape deploy-verify pass.
> - `decorator.py` partial-payload de-dup (COMMONS_REQUESTS row 13) — touches every model's runtime path →
>   per the plan, do in a W3b pass WITH a representative deploy (Milestone-B-adjacent).
>
> **REMAINING — GATED (needs Modal/R2/infra or a human):**
> 1. **R2 secret-mount activation switch** — make the `cloudflare-r2` Modal secret mount optional
>    (`downloader.py:113`) so a creds-less deploy can start. Code task but Modal-validated → Milestone B.
> 2. **Needs-human** — the `MAINTAINER_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` items (license confirmations; SECURITY/CoC
>    contacts; tempro all-rights-reserved decision; infra: Modal CI token on `modal-dev` env, deploy-gate).
> 3. **(optional) Round-2 verification review** before the big spend.
> 4. **Milestone B** — full deploy + golden-fixture + integration/deployment matrix (§1). Deploy-validates
>    the R2 HTTP read + secret-mount switch + all self-population; applies the PHASE_B_DEFERRED response-shape
>    renames (deploy-verify then apply). **Before any real weight WRITES, do the `biolm-hub/`-prefix R2
>    re-path** (else weights land under the old prefix — see `RENAME_TO_BIOLM_HUB.md` §4).
> 5. **W-launch** — the full `RENAME_TO_BIOLM_HUB.md` rebrand bundle + delete `.planning/` + nuke history +
>    flip public.

## STATUS SNAPSHOT — what's DONE (committed on `main`)
- **Commons + global rules** (W1/W2/W3a/W-acq/W6/W7/W17) — earlier commits.
- **W5 per-model hardening** — 43 SHIP models hardened; **nanobert + propermab EXCLUDED** (confirmed
  NonCommercial); matrix/licenses corrected (igbert/igt5→CC-BY-4.0, esmc Cambrian-Open). 43 SHIP / 16 EXCLUDE.
- **Milestone A** — peptides + esm2-150m deploy + invoke on `biolm-models-dev`; esm2 self-populated `biolm-public`.
- **W4 self-populating acquisition — 100% code-complete** — commons cleanup (marker-gate correctness fix +
  `r2_then_archive` + curated API + dead-code) + EVERY weight model migrated to the canonical wrappers +
  4 wrapper patterns deploy-proven (sample-validate) + 2 build fixes (StrEnum-3.10 shim; hf_hub in download
  layer). evo + progen2 resolved; pro1/esmstabp = documented exceptions.
- **boltzgen** internal protocols/output-delivery removed.
- **W8 Gateway — ✅ DONE (`97a513f`)** — bare + cached gateways, config-driven discovery (AST deleted),
  status_code→HTTP promotion, CI guard. Bare gateway deploy-proven on dev (see §4).
- **W9 Web app — ✅ DONE** — `bm serve` local catalog web app (browse + run individual models, no gateway
  deploy needed); deployed/undeployed greying; `[serve]` extra. bm-serve deploy-proven; T0+T1+Opus. See §4.

## 0. ROUND-1 INDEPENDENT REVIEW + USER DECISIONS (2026-06-30)
Full multi-agent review in `.planning/reviews/round-1/` (README dashboard + FIX_PLAN.md + 44 `models/` +
12 `global/`). 540 findings → 529 after adversarial verification: 🔴31 / 🟠222 / 🟡276. Framework sound;
debt is application-level. **Modal-free fix campaign IN PROGRESS** (grouped/triaged per FIX_PLAN.md).

**User decisions (2026-06-30) — APPLIED / IN-PROGRESS:**
- **DROP `clean`** (permanent — upstream is a Non-Exclusive Research Use / non-commercial license).
- **DROP `boltz` + `rfd3` + `esmstabp`** (temporary — re-inclusion conditions in `.planning/reviews/round-1/DROPPED_MODELS.md`).
  esmstabp = self-trained RF, no public source, not OSS-reproducible yet (also voids its 🔴 `biolm-modal` `_train.py` bug + its Milestone-B manual-upload blocker).
- **`peptides` → relicense to GPL-3.0** (its `peptides.py` dep declares GPLv3 copyleft) + fix attribution.
- **`tempro` → KEEP**; research upstream license aggressively; if none found, ship an explicit
  "no upstream license found" notice (do NOT fabricate MIT).
- **Modal env names:** dev/testing = `biolm-models-dev`, prod = `biolm-models` (replaces internal `qa`).
- **`esmfold` pLDDT:** standardize on the correct convention (pLDDT is 0–100; align all models' plddt to 0–100).
- Catalog: 43 SHIP → **39 SHIP** (+ dummy) after the 4 drops (clean, boltz, rfd3, esmstabp).

**OPEN QUESTIONS — NEED A USER RESPONSE (tracked so they aren't lost):**
1. **R2 anonymous public-read on `biolm-public`** — make it anonymously readable so the "no creds beyond
   Modal" happy path is true? YES → user enables public read on the bucket + I add the unsigned-read code
   path (`signature_version=UNSIGNED`); NO → I soften the README claim. Gates the credential-less quickstart.
2. **SECURITY.md / CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md contacts** — need a real security-report email + CoC enforcement
   contact (currently placeholders that must not ship).
3. **Copyleft inclusion** — confirm it's acceptable to ship one GPL-3.0 (copyleft) model (`peptides`) in
   the otherwise-permissive catalog.
4. **Knowledge-base PDF policy** — `sources.yaml` `*_r2` paths point at third-party paper PDFs; confirm
   none of those raw PDFs land in public `biolm-public` (W-sec).
5. **peptides license — NEW INFO may flip the decision.** The review found the wrapped `peptides==0.3.4`
   (althonos/peptides.py) is *self-contradictory*: its source + `COPYING` say **GPL-3.0** but its PyPI
   metadata says **MIT**. Per your "relicense it" call I set the model to GPL-3.0 (conservative) with the
   contradiction documented in its sources.yaml/README/LICENSE. **If the maintainer confirms upstream is
   really MIT, peptides can ship permissively instead** (no copyleft). Needs a maintainer/legal ping to
   althonos. Also: vendor the full GPL-3.0 text into `models/peptides/LICENSE` once the license is confirmed
   (currently a GPL-3.0 notice + canonical-URL pointer, to stay filter-safe and not presume the resolution).

### Fix campaign Phase B — DONE (2026-06-30; one agent content-filtered, recovered in-context)
Per-model fan-out applied each model's review findings + cross-cutting decisions (39 SHIP + dummy, 298
model files). **peptides** recovered by hand (license/attribution → GPL-3.0 + althonos/Larralde, `557`→~140,
dangling camsol/biolmtox2/esmstabp slugs removed, display_name). 3 residual `qa` deploy comments swept.
**Verified:** `biolm-modal`=0 + `qa`=0 across shipped dirs; schema guard ✓40; ruff clean; `mkdocs build
--strict` green (39); unit tests 6 fail = ONLY the pre-existing pandas (boltzgen/test_unit) + R2-creds
(test_cache) env issues (Phase A fixed the 14 cli/test_kb). **Deferred (not done) → see
`.planning/reviews/round-1/PHASE_B_DEFERRED.md`:** response-shape renames (Milestone B deploy-verify),
cross-model coordinated renames, commons-scope lifts (W3b), R2-artifact-dependent items (Milestone B).

### Fix campaign Phase A — DONE (2026-06-30; one agent failed, recovered in-context)
Foundational shared-file fixes landed + verified (ruff/black clean, commons imports, `mkdocs build
--strict` green, `cli/test_kb.py` 35 pass [was 14 fail], `.github/scripts` 53 pass, schema guard ✓40,
new `docs/test_docgen.py` 18 pass): commons de-internalized (`qa`→`biolm-models-dev`, `biolm-modal`
gone, `ServerError` added to ERROR_MAP, `parquet_utils.py` deleted, cosine-tolerance + runner fixes);
gateway dead billing schema (`introspection.py`) deleted; CLI fixed (`bm kb matrix`/`bm kb missing`,
`r2 cat` UTF-8, `main.py` BioLM-Modal, `test_kb` typer); dummy template de-internalized; docs-site
generator fixed (tagline blockquote, same-page anchors) + tests added; `.github/scripts` hardened;
`ci.yml` W11 ref removed.
**DEFERRED from Phase A (the ci-config agent failed; these are risky/manual, do in a focused pass):**
(a) include `.github/scripts` in CI mypy — surfaces **67 pre-existing type errors**, fix as its own pass
(FIX_PLAN S12); (b) gitleaks secret-scan gate — scans full git history (still holds internal refs;
history is nuked at launch) → do at **W-sec** (S12/security); (c) narrow the over-broad `**/test*.py`
T20 ignore — `commons/testing/fixture.py` legitimately prints (generation tool); needs an explicit
exempt rather than a naive narrowing (FIX_PLAN S16); (d) `deploy.yml` enforced required-reviewers = the
GitHub Environment setting in the manual-actions list.

## SEQUENCING (ratified by user 2026-06-28) — build ALL features first, deploy/test the full matrix LAST
**Do NOT run the full Milestone-B deploy matrix mid-build.** Order of remaining work:
**(1)** finish ALL platform features across the board — W8 gateway → W9 web app → W10 CLI → W11 CI →
W12 shared test assets → W13 skills → W14 docs (incl. public CLAUDE.md) → W3b commons reconciliation →
W-sec — then **(2)** run **Milestone B** (deploy + golden fixtures + integration/deployment matrix for
ALL models) ONCE at the end, then **(3)** W-launch.
**INTERIM VALIDATION = the proven cheap pattern:** for any NEW commons/architecture change, deploy +
invoke ONE representative model **per variant group the change spans** (as done for esm2 / peptides /
the 4 wrapper samples) to confirm the approach is sound before fanning out — cheap, catches systemic
issues early (it already caught the StrEnum-3.10 + hf_hub build bugs), and avoids premature full-matrix
Modal spend. **Scaling rule (user-clarified 2026-06-28):** the count scales with the number of distinct
variant groups the change touches — if commons logic has, say, 2 variants (e.g. two download-wrapper
patterns, or CPU vs GPU build paths), pick TWO representatives (one from each group), not one overall.

## 1. MILESTONE B — full deploy + integration/deployment test matrix  ⟵ runs LAST (after all features)
**Needs user go-ahead (real Modal spend).** Deploy ALL models to `biolm-models-dev` (then prod
`biolm-models`) and run T2 (integration) + T3 (deployment) per `04_TESTING_STRATEGY`. It accomplishes:
- **(a) Self-population for every model** — so far only esm2 + the 4 sample patterns (mpnn/igt5/esm_if1/
  abodybuilder3) are deploy-proven. All others are Modal-free-validated only.
- **(b) Populates `biolm-public` weights** for all shipped models (first writes).
- **(c) GOLDEN TEST FIXTURES** — input/output JSON goldens do NOT exist in `biolm-public` yet; integration
  tests compare against them, so they must be **generated per-model (`fixture.py`) + reviewed**. **Major
  sub-task.** Fixtures must lazy-load (W17 — already enforced in code).
- **(d) Cache-HIT round-trip** — deploy twice; only esm2's R2 *write* was observed (read-back reasoned).

### Per-model deploy watch-items (flagged during W4 migration — verify on first deploy):
- **esmfold** — 3B-backbone identity inferred as `esm2_t36_3B_UR50D` (+regression); if wrong, the cached set
  won't match the runtime read.
- **immunefold** — ESM2-3B backbone load path; large Zenodo/LFS redirects.
- **boltz** — `mols.tar` (1.86 GB) LFS 302 redirect; flat `--cache` layout incl. `mols.tar`.
- **evo** — does the Evo library honor the `HF_HUB_CACHE` redirect (build + runtime)? If not it re-downloads
  each cold start (still works, just no R2 cache).
- **progen2** — GCS tarball streaming + the full 4-variant shared-prefix layout (oas/medium/large/BFD90).
- **antifold** — OPIG `model.pt` URL (mpnn confirmed IPD resolves; antifold's OPIG host untested).
- **conda/python-3.10 models** (immunefold, deepviscosity, thermompnn, thermompnn_d) — confirm the StrEnum
  3.10 shim (abodybuilder3 + esm_if1 already deploy-confirmed it; immunebuilder is 3.12).

### ~~esmstabp — manual upload~~ → DROPPED (2026-06-30)
esmstabp was dropped from the catalog (self-trained RF, no public source, not OSS-reproducible yet —
see `.planning/reviews/round-1/DROPPED_MODELS.md`). The previous "maintainer must train + upload the
`{1..4}.joblib`" requirement is therefore **void** for v1 launch.

### Antibody golden-OUTPUT regen (W5-deferred):
`ablang2` generate, `igbert` paired-generate, `antifold` generate+score now serialize the canonical
`heavy_chain`/`light_chain` output keys. Their R2 golden OUTPUT fixtures (old keys) need a **reviewed**
regen (not blind). Input renames are alias-covered → no regen.

---

## 2. W3b — commons reconciliation pass (one reviewed pass; deferred commons edits)
- **`COMMONS_REQUESTS.md` (1 open row):** remove `protocols_r2_bucket_secret` + `protocols_r2_bucket_secret_name`
  from `commons/util/config.py` and delete the `protocols-r2-bkt` Modal secret (boltzgen no longer uses it).
- **Phase-1-deferred dead-code** (remove once their per-model consumers stop reading them): `AcquisitionResult.
  bypass_detected`/`bypass_locations` (still read by `chai1`/`ablang2` download.py — evo no longer does, it was
  migrated); `LibrarySourceConfig.monitor_directories` (passed by chai1/ablang2/msa_transformer, now
  accepted-unread); `HfSourceConfig.use_auth_token` (evo2 passes it, no-op). Migrate those readers, then delete.
- **`r2_then_archive` NIT-1** (Phase-1 review): cross-dest clobber edge case — if `extract_subtrees` maps one
  entry to `""` (target_dir root) plus sibling subdirs and the `""` entry isn't first, `rmtree` wipes a sibling.
  **Fix before ANY model wires `r2_then_archive`** (none does yet). Clear all dests up front, or forbid `""`+siblings.
- **Lower-priority** (Phase-1 audit §d): simplify `get_r2_prefix_from_target_dir`; reconcile/remove the packaged
  `models/commons/storage/DOWNLOAD_MODEL_WEIGHTS_README.md` (it would ship); confirm NGC secret unneeded (NIM excluded).

---

## 3. LICENSE / secret hygiene (W-sec, pre-launch)
Per-model LICENSE files frequently carry **inferred** copyright holders/years (flagged in-file). Confirm before launch:
- **esmc** — Cambrian-Open "Built with ESM" attribution + naming; confirm vs the upstream agreement.
- **esmstabp** — upstream ships no LICENSE file → MIT is inferred.
- **pro1** — Apache per HF card (GitHub no LICENSE) + the **Llama-3.1-8B base** under Meta's Community License.
- **igbert/igt5** — CC-BY-4.0 (attribution obligation).
- Inferred holders/years across Batch B/E/F + boltz/chai1/rf3/rfd3/boltzgen/abodybuilder3/immunebuilder/etc.
- W-sec: gitleaks/trufflehog scan (CI + pre-launch); confirm `biolm-public` holds **no raw third-party PDFs**;
  fix any remaining internal identifiers. **De-internalization sweep — `biolm-modal`→`biolm-public`.** W14
  fixed the PROSE leaks that render into the docs site (`models/esmstabp/{README,MODEL}.md` example paths +
  `models/dummy/BIOLOGY.md`); the temp bootstrap `CLAUDE.md` was replaced by the permanent public one. **Still
  open (functional path-strings — change with care, may affect Milestone B R2 paths):**
  `models/dummy/sources.yaml` (comment), `models/esmstabp/{_train.py,download.py}`,
  `models/boltz/{fixture,test}.py`, `models/deepviscosity/fixture.py`, `models/commons/storage/cache.py`.
- **abodybuilder3 README doc bug (found in W14 review):** `models/abodybuilder3/README.md` says output pLDDT is
  on a `0–1` scale, but upstream (`compute_plddt` multiplies by 100) + BIOLOGY.md/comparison.yaml say `0–100`.
  Fix the README in a docs pass (schema description is correct at 0–100).

---

## 4. Remaining project phases (`03_WORKSTREAMS`)
- **W8 Gateway — ✅ DONE + bare-gateway DEPLOY-PROVEN (2026-06-28).** Bare `gateway/server.py`
  (`biolm-gateway`) + cached `gateway/server_with_cache.py` (`biolm-gateway-cache`; both response-cache
  tiers OFF by default behind `BIOLM_CACHE_ENABLED`); shared core `gateway/routing.py`. ASGI fn = `web`
  (qualified `gateway.server.web` — renamed from the funky `gateway.gateway.gateway`). AST class-discovery
  deleted → config-driven `modal_class_name` (set on dummy too); routes via `modal_app_name`.
  status_code→HTTP promotion = **YES** (proven live: esm2 out-of-bounds layers → HTTP 400 `user.validation`).
  CI guard `gateway/test_discovery.py` (88 checks). Stripped auth/billing/analytics/state (−1.8k LOC).
  **Bare gateway deployed to `biolm-models-dev` + smoke-tested:** health (130 routes), peptides encode
  (200, real features), status_code promotion (400). The **cached** gateway is NOT deploy-tested yet (its
  `_run_cached` + lazy cache-stack import + `requests==2.32.3` dep are analysis-validated only) → Milestone B.
  **Deferred to W3b** (COMMONS_REQUESTS): de-dup the partial-payload closure (`decorator.py`); fix/remove the
  `local_models_path` misnomer.
  Deploy gotchas found+fixed: file `gateway/gateway.py` shadowed the `gateway` package on `modal deploy`
  (→ renamed `server.py`); `local_models_path`=`models/commons` not `models/` (→ gateway computes the real
  dir); the cache stack imports `requests` (→ lazy-imported so the bare gateway stays minimal).
- **W9 Web app — ✅ DONE + bm-serve DEPLOY-PROVEN (2026-06-28).** Local catalog web app: `bm serve` runs
  the gateway routing **in-process** (no gateway deployment needed) + mounts the catalog UI; forms POST
  same-origin to `/api/v3/...` which calls your **individual** deployed Modal models. Deployed=active /
  undeployed=greyed (deployment status from `modal app list --json`, best-effort tri-state True/False/None,
  TTL-cached, off-loop). `gateway/catalog/{deployment_status,mount}.py` + `cli/serve.py` (`bm serve`
  `--host/--port/--env/--gateway-url`). Deployed gateway can opt into the catalog via `BIOLM_GATEWAY_CATALOG=1`
  (isolated in try/except; status query skipped in-container). Web deps = **`[serve]` extra** (`pip install
  '.[serve]'`; fastapi pinned ==0.112.0 to match the image's FastAPI internals). Validated: live `bm serve`
  against dev (6 deployed/73 undeployed correct) + 5 unit/route tests (TestClient, Modal-free) + fresh Opus
  review (all 🟠/🟡 addressed). The **deployed-catalog path** (`BIOLM_GATEWAY_CATALOG=1`) is NOT deploy-tested
  (Milestone B). NOTE for W14 docs: warn that a deployed catalog / `bm serve --host 0.0.0.0` is unauthenticated
  and bills the operator's Modal account.
- **W10 CLI — ✅ DONE (Modal-free; T0 + CLI smoke + fresh-Opus review).** New `bm setup`
  (`cli/setup.py`): network-free Modal-auth check (REQUIRED → non-zero exit + `modal token new`
  guidance if missing) + OPTIONAL local R2 creds (AWS_*); rich summary. New `bm cache`
  (`cli/cache.py`): `status` reports whether response caching (`BIOLM_CACHE_ENABLED`, off by default)
  would bake into a deploy; it's a deploy-time setting. `bm deploy --cache/--no-cache` flag bakes the
  env var in (default None = leave env untouched). **`bm r2` is now STRICTLY READ-ONLY** (user
  directive: OSS repo, no writes): removed `cp`/`rm` + all write helpers (`upload_to_r2`/`_upload_one`/
  `should_ignore_path`/`delete_r2_objects`) + a dead vestigial `@click.group() def r2()`; `cp`→read-only
  `download` (R2→local); kept `ls`/`download`/`cat`/`du`/`download-outputs`; de-internalized
  `biolm-modal`→`biolm-public` in docstrings (incl. `models/dummy/MODEL.md`). Quickstart verified
  Modal-free (esm2 already deploy-proven; no re-deploy). **Pre-existing (NOT W10):** `cli/test_kb.py
  TestValidateCmd` 12 failures = `typer.Exit` vs `click.exceptions.Exit` mismatch in `kb.py` tests
  (confirmed on a clean tree) → fix in W11/W17 test-collection pass.
- **🟣 R2 PUBLIC-READ MODEL (user-surfaced 2026-06-28, during W10; NOT yet implemented — decision +
  infra + commons change).** Intended end-state: the BioLM-owned **`biolm-public` bucket should be
  anonymously public-READABLE but not writable**. Today the Modal download layer mounts
  `cloudflare_r2_secret` even to READ public weights (this is why Milestone A's esm2 deploy blocked on a
  missing secret), so the README's "happy path needs no credentials beyond Modal" is **not yet true**.
  To make it true: **(infra, user)** enable anonymous/unsigned reads on `biolm-public` (R2 public bucket
  / r2.dev / bucket policy); **(code, commons)** give the R2 read client an unsigned-access path
  (`botocore Config(signature_version=UNSIGNED)`) when no creds are present, and stop REQUIRING the
  `cloudflare-r2` secret for read-only public-bucket access (writes/self-population to your own bucket
  still need creds). This is a W4/W3b-adjacent commons change + a representative deploy to validate —
  **Modal-spend-gated → fold into the interim-validation pattern or Milestone B.** `bm setup` already
  frames R2 as optional in anticipation of this.
- **W11 CI/CD — ✅ DONE (Modal-free; T0 + 60 script-tests + fresh-Opus SECURITY review → "core isolation
  holds, no 🔴").** Safe tier (`ci.yml`, already on every PR: style+mypy+unit+docs, `contents: read`, no
  secrets, fork-safe) + new CI-script test step. **New `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** — maintainer-gated
  `pull_request_target`: `revoke-on-push` (removes the `deploy-approved` label on every push → binds approval
  to the reviewed SHA) + secret-free `detect` (label-gated) + `deploy-and-test` matrix (ONLY job with secrets,
  scoped to a `modal-dev` GitHub Environment; `bm deploy`→`-m integration`→`-m deployment`, env
  `biolm-models-dev`, R2_* secrets→AWS_* env). **Ported `.github/scripts/`** detect_models.py + ci_utils.py +
  analyze_commons_dependencies.py (`--smart` dependency-narrowing) + tests, de-internalized (billing paths
  dropped). Review hardening applied: model-name validator `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$` + quoted env vars (shell-injection
  defense-in-depth), `persist-credentials: false` on the untrusted-code checkout, `actions/setup-python` in
  detect. `make test-github-scripts` wired into `check`+CI. CONTRIBUTING documents the gate. **FOLLOW-UPS
  (not blockers):** (a) `deploy.yml` is authored + statically validated only — **first LIVE run = a real gated
  PR / Milestone B**; (b) **user must configure** the `deploy-approved` label, the `modal-dev` Environment +
  required reviewers, and `MODAL_TOKEN_*`/`R2_*` as **environment** secrets (see the deploy.yml header);
  (c) `--smart` uses a two-dot diff (`git fetch --depth=1`) → may over-detect if base advanced (cost only);
  (d) the `cli/test_kb.py TestValidateCmd` 12 fails (typer.Exit vs click.exceptions.Exit) still open (W17).
- **W12 Shared test-asset library — ✅ DONE (Modal-free; T0 + 12 commons/testing tests + fresh-Opus review,
  no 🔴).** New `models/commons/testing/shared_assets.py` (importable canonical constants: `STANDARD_PROTEIN`
  61aa + `STANDARD_PROTEIN_STABILITY` 65aa, each with its `test-data/shared/<cat>/<name>` canonical R2 name).
  Runner+generator gained a shared-aware resolver `_fixture_r2_path` — a fixture path starting with `shared/`
  resolves to `test-data/shared/...` (else per-model, byte-identical to before); read (runner) + input-read
  (generator) symmetric, outputs stay per-model. **2 assets wired across 7 models** (esm2/esm1b/esmc/e1/dsm +
  esmstabp/temberture) — de-duped the standard protein that was hardcoded 15×; substring-safe (longer composite
  sequences left intact). `test_shared_assets.py` (6 Modal-free tests). Convention propagated to CONTRIBUTING +
  the dummy template; `02` reconciled. **FOLLOW-UP (Milestone B):** populate `test-data/shared/` in `biolm-public`
  + live-test the `shared/`-path read; only asset population is incremental (no model references a `shared/` path
  yet — current reuse is via the importable constants).
- **W13 Skills — ✅ DONE (Modal-free; T0/pre-commit clean + in-context review).** Ported + **SIMPLIFIED**
  the 3 checked-in skills (note: `code-quality` never existed). User-directed **aggressive collapse**:
  `model-implementation` 12→**7 files**, 8 phases→**4** (investigate→implement→validate→document; dropped the
  plan-doc/tiered-review/standalone-verification ceremony); `model-knowledge-base` 16→**5 files**, **acquisition
  pipeline DROPPED entirely** (OSS contributors have no R2 write — `bm r2 cp` gone) → it now only authors the 5
  knowledge-graph files from PUBLIC sources; `pr-management` de-internalized (1 file). Total 29→**13 files**.
  README-standard conflict RESOLVED (points to `models/dummy/README.md`; dropped the 100-line rule + ESM-2
  inline example). Validate step = `make check` MANDATORY + OPTIONAL local deploy (full matrix is W11
  maintainer-gated). De-internalized throughout (biolm-modal→biolm-public, qa→biolm-models-dev, billing→
  ModelMixin, "do NOT run make check" INVERTED, Modal-Sandbox section dropped, action list completed). Also fixed
  `models/dummy/sources.yaml` KB-path comments. **PROCESS NOTE:** the 2 model-skill writer subagents + the Opus
  reviewer all hit transient infra failures (401 / stall) mid-run — I completed the 4 unreached files + did the
  review IN-CONTEXT (verified every commons API against real OSS code; **fixed one real drift**: the skill's
  `download.py` taught the hand-rolled `AcquisitionConfig` instead of the canonical `r2_then_hf/library/urls`
  wrappers). **FOLLOW-UP:** a fresh-Opus skills review never completed cleanly — re-run one when infra is stable
  (low risk; in-context review was thorough).
- **W14 Docs site + DX — ✅ DONE (Modal-free; `mkdocs build --strict` green, fresh-Opus infra review).**
  Build-time generation via `mkdocs-gen-files`+`mkdocs-literate-nav` (pinned to pre-`properdocs` versions to
  avoid that dep's injected FUD banner): `docs/gen_pages.py`+`docs/_docgen.py` emit one rich page per model
  (badges → at-a-glance from comparison.yaml → auto API/schema field tables + collapsible raw JSON → README/
  MODEL/BIOLOGY embedded with heading-demotion + GitHub link-rewrite + HTML-comment stripping → license/papers
  from sources.yaml, internal `*_r2` paths NOT rendered) + catalog index + quickstart + single-source-mirrored
  Philosophy/Contributing/Future-work. Dormant Pages deploy `.github/workflows/docs.yml` (gated on `PAGES_ENABLED`
  var). **Permanent public `CLAUDE.md` authored; temp bootstrap replaced.**
  **MAJOR ADD-ON (user-requested): per-field OpenAPI descriptions across ALL 44 models.** Mechanism =
  `Field(description=...)` (the only thing Pydantic renders; comments don't; attribute-docstrings fail for
  sadie's v1 path). Canonical glossary (`tooling/field_glossary.yaml`) + CI guard `tooling/check_schema_docs.py`
  (checks RENDERED descriptions + glossary drift; wired into `make check`+`ci.yml`). Done via a write→review
  agent fan-out (sonnet writers, opus reviewers); global checker `✓ (44 models)`, ruff+black clean.
  **Fixed a pre-existing LATENT BUG: 6 models (igbert/igt5/boltzgen/immunefold/prody/spurs, 21 fields) had
  `Field` nested in `Optional[Annotated[...]]`, which Pydantic silently drops — so their descriptions AND
  `validation_alias`/constraints never rendered. Restructured to field-level `Field` → descriptions render +
  the dead `heavy`/`light` aliases + length constraints now work.** ⚠️ This is a validation BEHAVIOR change
  (aliases/constraints now active) — re-confirm at Milestone B (canonical-input goldens unaffected; only
  previously-ignored aliases/constraints newly apply). mypy stays CI-gated (1.5.1 crashes on numpy stubs locally).
- **W15 Off-Modal Dockerfile** — OPTIONAL (go/defer decided late); eligible models only (no GPU-at-build, public source).
- **W-sec** — secret + license hygiene (see §3); gates Stage 7.
- **W-launch** — irreversible ordered sequence: R2 completeness sweep + sec sign-off → public CLAUDE.md → delete
  `.planning/` → nuke git history → flip repo public (gated on marketing material).
- **esmfold2** — SHIP-LATER: add only after its upstream PR (`aqamar/add-esmfold2`) merges into `biolm-modal`
  `main`, then re-confirm weights license (incl. the ESMC-6B backbone).
- **FUTURE_WORK.md** (public, deferred-on-purpose): benchmarks (ProteinGym), self-improving skills, BuildKit fast
  builds, the off-Modal Dockerfile tail.

## 5. Environment / process notes (for whoever resumes)
- **Deploys MUST set `MODAL_ENVIRONMENT=biolm-models-dev`** — the local active Modal profile is the internal
  `qa` env. Run modal via `.venv/bin/modal` (modal 1.3.5). Both `biolm-models` (prod) + `biolm-models-dev` exist.
- **Currently deployed on `biolm-models-dev`** (idle = $0; `modal app stop <name> --env biolm-models-dev` to remove):
  `peptides`, `esm2-150m`, `protein-mpnn`, `igt5-paired`, `esm-if1`, `abodybuilder3-plddt`, **`biolm-gateway`**
  (bare gateway, W8 smoke-test; URL `https://biolm-biolm-models-dev--biolm-gateway-web.modal.run`).
- **Secrets in `biolm-models-dev`:** `cloudflare-r2` + `hf-api-token` (user-added). `protocols-r2-bkt` NOT needed
  (boltzgen fixed). `ngc-cli-api-key` NOT needed (NIM excluded).
- **T0 gate** = `uvx ruff@0.6.9 check --no-fix <paths>` + `uvx black@24.10.0 --check` (a bare newer ruff gives
  ~hundreds of false positives — UP045 etc.). mypy is CI-gated (1.5.1 crashes on numpy stubs locally).
- **Build-order rule:** any model whose download fallback imports a library/`huggingface_hub` at build time must
  list it in `setup_download_layer(..., extra_pip_packages=[...])` (else `ModuleNotFound` mid-build).
- **`biolm-public` is not listable from the local shell** (R2 creds live only in the Modal secret).
